### Hi there 👋


#Hello world, I'am Anthony

🦈  I'am Junior Developer who sails on the virtual oceans to become a better developer. 🦈

I am a competent person, who likes to work diligently by applying a certain polish to my deliverables.
I enjoy discussing ideas with others and debating intelligently and seriously.
I don't shy away from difficulties and I like to find alone or with my collaborators the solution to a given technical problem.
I am someone creative or in any case who has a pronounced attraction for the arts and letters.
I am creating my board game.
I have a music group under my belt, I have been playing the guitar for 12 years.
I am a fan of history, especially that which concerns the Navy.
I like going out to museums, to the cinema.
